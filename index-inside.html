                        my biggest goal is to be cyber security<br> of the republic of the philippines.<br><br>
                        
                        And my second goal is to make an quality game<br>
                        that never exist in our world and what im thinking<br>
                        is do an RPG game that the quality is more than GTA<br>
                        i know it is imposible but for me im gonna make in posible<br><br>

                        So now my hobbies or what I want to do<br>
                        first is what i am passionate about now, when i ride motorcycles
                        I used to be obsessed with playing basketball, but since the pandemic<br>
                        I have lost interest in basketball, idont know if why did i also try learn drums
                        way back 2021 my mom bought me a drum set for 3 to 4 months i studied drums but unfortunately I got
                        bored rigth away since I sold my drums and bought a pc set and there I was very addicted especially to the game
                        GTA V in GTA V started why do I want to become a programmer now because in GTA V roleplay I 
                        experience how to code/programming so I became obsessed with codes because of this game and untill now I am 
                        learning some programs that will help me in college.
